									<h3>Did you Know?</h3>
									<p>Everyone can benefit from physical activity. For most people, it is possible to begin exercising on your own at a slow pace. If you have never exercised before, start with a 10-minute period of light exercise. A brisk walk every day is a good first exercise. Slowly increase how hard you exercise and for how long.</p>

									<h3>Did you Know?</h3>
									<p>Working out with a friend is more fun than working out alone. An exercise buddy can keep you motivated when you donâ€™t feel like exercising. You will be much less likely to cancel exercise if you know someone is counting on you to be there. And when you reach your exercise goals, you'll have someone to celebrate with.</p>
